## **Session Structure**

### **Phase 1: Exercise Introduction (5 minutes)**
- **Quick recap**: "What regularization techniques have we covered?"
- **Exercise overview**: Working through a training script with TODO sections covering all previous topics
- **Approach**: Student implements while instructor guides and reviews concepts

### **Phase 2: Guided Implementation (45 minutes)**
Student completes TODO sections covering:

**Core Regularization (TODOs 1-3):**
- Implement dropout layers in model architecture
- Add L1/L2 weight decay to optimizer
- Configure learning rate scheduler

**Advanced Techniques (TODOs 4-6):**
- Implement batch normalization placement
- Add gradient clipping to training loop
- Create data augmentation pipeline

**Training Stability (TODOs 7-8):**
- Implement early stopping mechanism
- Add label smoothing to loss calculation

**Analysis & Visualization (TODOs 9-10):**
- Create training curves comparison
- Implement misclassification analysis

### **Phase 3: Results & Reflection (10 minutes)**
- Review completed implementation
- Quick discussion of which techniques were most challenging to implement
- Preview of what's coming next in the course
